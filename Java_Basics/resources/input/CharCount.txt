This is a paragraph that I typed to have a bunch of various letters and symbols for the program to count. 
It cost me $0.00 to make which I only mention so that I can have a '$' in it!!! 
How am I supposed to add the rest of the symbols though?? 
(I won't know the exact # of each thing in this file, so I'll have to manually check if it's right each time.)
74 + -54 = (80/8)*2
